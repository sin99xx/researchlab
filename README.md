# sin99xx · Warisjeet Singh

Security researcher. I find memory-safety and logic bugs in software people trust — then I write the tooling that finds the next one. The diagram above is `CVE-2026-48004`.

The handle is `sinner`. No competition. I only see me.

## CVEs — four assigned

Each is against shipping software.

| | target | class | what it gives you |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`CVE-2026-48004`** | QEMU | heap UAF | Freed object reachable from guest-controlled state in device emulation — the front half of a guest-to-host escape in virtualized, multi-tenant cloud. → fixed upstream [`5a8da7e`](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/5a8da7e979f1f56b1cab82c2354833f309f1a78f) |
| **`CVE-2026-48840`** | Exim | pre-auth leak | Uninitialised-stack leak in the PROXY-protocol parser, reachable before auth. An ASLR-defeat primitive that weakens mitigations on internet-facing mail servers before anyone logs in. → [advisory](https://exim.org/static/doc/security/EXIM-Security-2026-05-19.1.txt) |
| **`CVE-2025-5009`** | Gemini · iOS | info disclosure | Snippet-share leaked the *entire* conversation history instead of the selected snippet. Private user data exposed in a consumer AI product at scale. |
| **`CVE-2026-4XXXX`** | Joomla | reserved | Disclosure pending. |

## Automated vulnerability research

I build AI-agent frameworks that drive zero-day discovery through large codebases — orchestration that triages reachable attack surface and surfaces candidates for a human to confirm. The CVEs above came out of this loop.

```
agents narrow the search.  the exploitation is mine.

## Bug bounty

Accepted findings across private and public programs on HackerOne.

```
KOHO ··········· rank #2

`KOHO` · `1win` · `DoorDash` · `Monero` · `Whoop` · `Eightfold` · private programs
— and a finding against the Bugcrowd platform itself.

### Back the research

This isn't a side hobby — it's 12–15 hour/day on the things above, self-funded, no employer behind it. If something I shipped saved you a CVE or taught you a primitive, you can put weight behind the next one.
